## Description
NEBULA is a sci-fi visual novel set in a distant solar system. A 3-year war has ravaged the galaxy, leaving the survivors to pick up the pieces. Amongst the victims are the mystical Milii people, who lost their planet in the final days of the war. 

You play as the First Mate on the crew of the Mercy, contracted by a humanitarian group called the Baransu Union.

The mission is simple: find the Milii people a new home. Accompanied by the Emissary and the mysterious Seed, you and your crew will explore the far reaches of the galaxy, encountering other survivors, natural terrors and interstellar marvels. 

Are you ready?

Though set in an unfamiliar galaxy, NEBULA is a familiar story about found family, facing loss and grief and learning to accept love from others.
